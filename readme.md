# Room 
Work in progress
<pre>[===20%          ]</pre>

I decided to create Escape Room VR game for Android smartphones.  

## My personal key goals:
* Prepare game with 10 minutes gameplay.
* Create every asset by myself (to learn 3D modeling more).
* Game should be playable without any controller (only VR headset).
* Deploy to Google Play. 
* No annoying ads.

## Technologies used
* Unity & C#
* Blender for 3D models
* vr.google.com for handling VR
